                I grew up with a strong sensitivity to people, animals, and the
                natural world that has deepened and evolved through the years. I
                received an MEd in Rehabilitation Counseling, and worked in this
                field for many years. I am also an artist, and I earned a BFA in
                Drawing and Painting. My interest in the spiritual and the
                psychological has taken me far below the surface of things. I
                found my calling when I studied spiritual healing and
                development with Martha Novak and Infinite Insight, a system to
                which I am still aligned. My system is a refined and
                sophisticated one, making me an adept at helping my clients
                achieve clarity, peace, joy, potential, heightened creativity,
                and more. I now help clients realize that God is a God of more,
                and is right there inside of us, ready to be used and enjoyed.
